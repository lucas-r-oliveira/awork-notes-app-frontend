# React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind application

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run the following commands:

I didn't try running the project with npm or yarn, but it should work the same way.
If that is not the case,

``` bash
# Install pnpm
npm install -g pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run the local server
pnpm run dev
```
